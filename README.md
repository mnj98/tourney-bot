# tourney-bot

This bot will be designed to help with logistics for the Onslaught Series Tournaments.

At the moment there are 3 planned features:
1. A signup command that automatically populates a google sheet with team info.
2. A command that can automatically calculate scores.
3. A timing system that allows Tournament Organizers to start timers for all teams and add time to specific teams if needed.
