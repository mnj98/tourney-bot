**Scoring Help Page**
-   You can use the four scoring sub-commands to calculate the score for your runs. Each sub-command is for a different number of maps.
-   The name of the map doesn't need to be spelled correctly as the bot should be able to figure it out if its close.
-   The same goes for the difficulty. You can use c3, cata3, or cataclysm3 to represent the same thing. c+ indicates Cata Dwons with Onslaught Plus.
-   The last parameter is the number of attempts it took to clear the map. Use 0 for a failed map.

-   The scoring is currently based on Year 2 Season 1 scoring, but will be updated if Season 2's scoring is different.

Examples:
/calculate-score one-map fort berger c3+ 2
/calculate-score two-maps fort berger c 0 convo c3 3
/calculate-score four-maps engines c3+ 1 convo c3+ 1 grain c3+ 1 halescourge c3+ 1
