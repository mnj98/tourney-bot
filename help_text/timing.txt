**Timing Help Page**
For Players:
-   Players cannot use the timing commands, but you should be aware that the bot will @ your team in the bot-notification channel when you can no longer start a map.

For TOs:
-   Start the timers for a time slot using /start-timers <timeslot> 180 5.
-       180 minutes is 3 hours, so using /start-timers <timeslot> 180 5 gives you 2h55m of playtime (following tourney-rules)
-   Use /add-time to add/subtract time to/from a team. Use a negative number for subtraction.
-       Team names shouldn't need to be spelled correctly. As long as you're close it should figure it out.
-   Clear all timers with /clear-all-timers
-   See the running timers with /timer-info

Examples:
/start-timers Tourney Time 180 5
/start-timers September 4 180 5
/add-time Gabex & Minions 15
/add-time Gabex's Minions -15  . . . This subtracts time from Gabex & Minions
